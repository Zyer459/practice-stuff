<!-- with php there are 2 basic ways to get outputs echo & print
they are almost the same, both are used for output 
only few small differences: 
    
    echo has no return value and, 
    print has a return value of 1 & can be used in expressions.
    echo can take multiple parameters (arguments), while print takes only 1 argument.
    echo is marginally faster than print
