<!-- 
PHP OOP:
       Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data,
       object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

       Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
       faster and easier to execute
       provides a clear structure for the programs
        helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
        makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

<!-- 
CLASS & OBJECTS: Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
 a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
 When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class,
 but each object will have different values for the properties.
